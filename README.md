# DSView 0.99upd

Due to DreamSourceLabs deprecating the DSLogic and DSLogic Plus they don't offer any newer software than v0.99. This repo keeps a fork of that version updated to be able to compile on newer versions of compilers and Linux versions.

This is a "Best effort" project. I only test on my own environment.
